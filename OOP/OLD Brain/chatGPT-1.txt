What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects. It helps organize code by grouping related properties and behaviors into objects.

Key Concepts of OOP:
1. Class:
A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines common properties and behaviors shared by all objects of that type.
Example: A Car class with properties like steering wheels, seats, brakes, etc.

2. Object:
An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity with specific characteristics and behaviors.

Constructors & Destructors
Constructor:

A special method with the same name as the class.
It is automatically called when an object is created.
It does not have a return type.
Allocates memory for the object.
Types of Constructors:

Default Constructor: Does not take any arguments.
Parameterized Constructor: Takes arguments to initialize an object.
Copy Constructor: Used to copy properties from one object to another.
Destructor:

Automatically called when an object is destroyed.
Frees allocated resources.
Opposite of a constructor.
Important OOP Features
this Pointer:

A special pointer in C++ that refers to the current object.
Example: this->property refers to the property of the current object.
Static Variables:

Declared as static inside a function or class.
They are initialized only once and persist for the lifetime of the program.
Overloading vs. Overriding:

Overloading: Compile-time polymorphism where multiple methods have the same name but different parameters.
Overriding: Runtime polymorphism where a subclass redefines a method from its parent class.
Why Use Object-Oriented Programming?
OOP provides several benefits, including:
âœ… Better Code Readability & Organization â€“ Code is structured into logical units.
âœ… Reusability â€“ Classes and objects can be reused across projects.
âœ… Encapsulation â€“ Data is hidden and accessed only through defined interfaces.
âœ… Maintainability & Scalability â€“ Code is easier to manage and extend.

By using OOP principles, we can create efficient, modular, and reusable code. ðŸš€
