Why a CSE Job Despite a Different Background?

Although I come from a Madrasah background, I have always been passionate about problem-solving, logic, and analytical thinking. Since childhood, I had a strong interest in Math and Science, which naturally led me to explore programming and software development.

In 2020, I started my journey as a full-stack developer, specializing in the MERN stack.

Beyond development, I actively solve problems on platforms like HackerRank, GeeksforGeeks, and LeetCode, which has strengthened my understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms. I enjoy tackling coding challenges, optimizing solutions, and continuously improving my problem-solving abilities.
